📊 Sales Prediction Using Linear Regression (Python)

This project demonstrates how to perform sales prediction using simple linear regression, implemented manually using NumPy, with data handling via Pandas and visualization using Matplotlib.

The model predicts future sales based on historical monthly sales data stored in an Excel file.

🚀 Features

Read sales data from an Excel file

Convert month names to numeric values

Implement Linear Regression from scratch (no ML libraries)

Visualize original data and regression line

Predict future sales for upcoming months

Interactive user input for custom predictions

🛠️ Technologies Used

Python 3.x

NumPy

Pandas

Matplotlib

📁 Dataset Format

The Excel file (Sales.xlsx) should contain the following columns:

Months	Sales
January	1200
February	1500
March	1700
...	...

Note: Month names must be spelled correctly and match the mapping used in the code.

📈 Workflow

Load sales data from Excel using Pandas

Map month names to numerical values

Convert sales data into NumPy arrays

Calculate:

Mean of months (x)

Mean of sales (y)

Slope (m) and intercept (b)

Plot:

Original sales data

Regression line

Predict sales for:

October

November

December

Accept user input for predicting sales of any month

📊 Visualization

The project generates:

Scatter plot of original sales data

Linear regression line showing trend

Combined plot including predicted future sales
