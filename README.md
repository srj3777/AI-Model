📊 Sales Prediction Using Linear Regression (Python)

This project demonstrates how to perform sales prediction using simple linear regression, implemented manually using NumPy, with data handling via Pandas and visualization using Matplotlib.
The model predicts future sales based on historical monthly sales data stored in an Excel file.

🚀 Features

	Read sales data from an Excel file
	Convert month names to numeric values
	Implement Linear Regression from scratch (using Mathematical Model)
	Visualize original data and regression line
	Predict future sales for upcoming months
	Interactive user input for custom predictions

🛠️ Technologies Used
	Python 3.x
	NumPy
	Pandas
	Matplotlib

📁 Dataset Format

The Excel file (Sales.xlsx) should contain the following columns:
 		Months, Sales


📈 Workflow
	Load sales data from Excel using Pandas
	Map month names to numerical values
	Convert sales data into NumPy arrays

Calculate:

	Mean of months (x)
	Mean of sales (y)
	Slope (m) and intercept (b)

Plot:
	Original sales data
	Regression line
	Predict sales for:
   October, November, December
	Accept user input for predicting sales of any month

📊 Visualization

The project generates:
	Scatter plot of original sales data
	Linear regression line showing trend
	Combined plot including predicted future sales
